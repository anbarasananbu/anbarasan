# Step 1: Download and install Voronoi package

Download Voronoi package from the official site [https://math.lbl.gov/voro++/](https://math.lbl.gov/voro++/) and extract into your user directory.

To install go to the voronoi folder
```bash
sudo make install ## use PREFIX=$user_folder for user directory installations 
```

# Step 2: Link the voronoi library

Go to lammps/lib/voronoi folder link the the library like below

```bash
ln -s /user_folder/voronoi/src linkinclude
ln -s /user_folder/voronoi/src linklib
```

# Step 3: Install Voronoi Package and other necessary packages
Go to the lammps/src folder and run the following command:
```bash
make yes-voronoi
```
# Step 4: LAMMPS installation

```
Build lammps executable with following commands,
```bash
make mpi                  # Build LAMMPS executable with serial
make mpi -j 8             # Build LAMMPS executable with parallel
```
After successfull compilation without any error, the lmp_mpi executable is available in the src directory.
