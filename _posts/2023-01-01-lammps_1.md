# Step 1: Download LAMMPS

Download LAMMPS from the official site [https://www.lammps.org/download.html](https://www.lammps.org/download.html) and extract the LAMMPS package into your user directory.

# Step 2: Configure GPU Support

Navigate to the "lib/gpu" folder and edit the "Makefile.mpi".

```makefile
CUDA_HOME = "location of the CUDA directory"  ## For example /usr/local/cuda
CUDA_LIB  = "location of the CUDA library"
```

Uncomment CUDA_ARCH. The type of hardware depends on your GPU model, so Google your NVIDIA GPU model to get the CUDA_ARCH type.
For example
```makefile
CUDA_ARCH = -arch=sm_86
```
Build the GPU library with the following command:
```makefile
make -f Makefile.mpi
```
# Step 3: Install GPU Package and other necessary packages
Run the following commands:
```bash
make yes-gpu
```
Build lammps executable with following commands,
```bash
make gpu                  # Build LAMMPS executable with serial
make gpu -j 8             # Build LAMMPS executable with parallel
```
After successfull compilation without any error, the lmp_gpu executable is available in the src directory.
