# Step 1: Download LAMMPS

Download LAMMPS from the official site [https://www.lammps.org/download.html](https://www.lammps.org/download.html) and extract the LAMMPS package into your user directory.

# Step 2: Configure GPU Support

Navigate to the "lib/gpu" folder and edit the "Makefile.mpi".

```makefile
CUDA_HOME = "location of the CUDA directory"  ## For example /usr/local/cuda
CUDA_LIB  = "location of the CUDA library"
'''
Uncomment CUDA_ARCH. The type of hardware depends on your GPU model, so Google your NVIDIA GPU model to get the CUDA_ARCH type.

Build the GPU library with the following command:
make -f Makefile.mpi

# Step 3: Install GPU Package and Other Necessary Packages
Run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
make yes-gpu
make gpu                  # Build LAMMPS executable with serial
make gpu -j 8             # Build LAMMPS executable with parallel
After compilation is finished, the lmp_gpu executable is available in the src directory.
